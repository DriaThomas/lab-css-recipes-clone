        <p class="info"> This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one quite like it. It
          will
          always
          be my favorite and has won me several first place prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your
          favorites as well!</p>

        <p> 1)Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees
          C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and
          bringto a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer.<br>
          2)Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded
          slightly. Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly
          so
          that it does not run off. <br>
          3)Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175
          degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.</p>
